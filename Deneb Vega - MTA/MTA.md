# MTA (Milestone Trend Analysis) for Deneb Power BI | Vega

## General Information

Feel free to use all files available in this folder for your project!
I can't guarantee an error free experience, for my case the chart worked flawless!

### Explaination

The files which end on ...TEMPLATE.deneb.json are Templates for the Deneb Visual in Power BI. The templates allow you to use
your own column names, which then will be mapped automatically to the correct columns within the spec.

**I highly recommend using the templates**

There are 2 templates available to use:
1. MTA_dynamic_size_TEMPLATE.deneb.json
2. MTA_static_size_TEMPLATE.deneb.json

The only difference between these to charts is that the first one scales its size automatically to the windows size of the Deneb visual 
that you are using in Power BI.
This chart has own flaw though! While zooming the charts start to flick a little!

This does not happen in the second template in which you specify height and width in pixel by yourself!
Here, no flicking occurs!

The colors used can currently only be controlled within the spec/ template.

I will upload a version that uses your Power BI theme colors.
